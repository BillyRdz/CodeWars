# CodeWars Daily Commitment Repo

- This repo contains my daily pushed code from Codewars to Github. 
- Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.
